This is a stable version that can successfully run the siftsmall dataset.

Key Features:
- Persistent connection optimization
- VDPF parallel computation with 32 processes
- Increased network timeout (30 seconds)
- Increased socket buffer (16MB)

Known Limitations:
- Data type mismatch issue with laion dataset (uint32 vs uint64)
- Further optimization needed to support large datasets

Performance Metrics (siftsmall):
- Phase 1 (VDPF evaluation): ~0.10 seconds
- Phase 2 (e/f calculation): ~0.01 seconds
- Phase 3 (data exchange): ~0.17 seconds
- Phase 4 (reconstruction): ~0.001 seconds
- Total: ~0.28 seconds
